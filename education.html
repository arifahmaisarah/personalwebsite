<center><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/NMxWFTYTiBy7CwRK7"><img src="image/skbbs.jpg" style="width: 260px; height: 260px;"></a></center><p>From 2008 - 2013, I went to <b>Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Baru Selayang, Selangor (SKBBS).</b> The school was 20 minutes away from my house by car.</p>
<br>
<center><h2 style="background-color: beige;">My Secondary School</h2></center>
<center><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZVV7MTFsZovKS4DG9"><img src="image/smksb.png" style="width: 260px; height: 260px;"></a></center>
<p>From 2014 - 2018, I went to <b>Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Selayang Bharu, Selangor (SMKSB).</b> The school was 5 minutes away from my house by walking. Here, I am a computer science student. Fyi, to be honest, this school is my favorite because here there are many fun and sweet memories to remember because I actively entered the editorial and scout club and also I met many good friends. Overall, I enjoyed my school days.</p>

<p>Diploma</p>
<center><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/4MPsi8WKpStZ5tBD9"><img src="image/uitmterengganu.png" style="width: 500px; height: 100px;"></a></center><p>From 2019 - 2021, I continued my studies at <b>UiTM Dungun, Terengganu.</b> Here, I took an accounting diploma for 5 semesters or 2 and a half years. I took this diploma because accounting was my favorite subject from high school. UiTM Dungun is the most beautiful university because of its location surrounded by nature. Facing the beach and surrounded by hills and forests makes the learning atmosphere there calm and comfortable. </p>
<br>

<p>Bachelor Degree</p>
<center><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/c7ZpddfbMREx9rKV7"><img src="image/uitmkb.png" style="width: 500px; height: 120px;"></a></center><p>From 2022 - now, I continued my  degree level in the field of business admin major in finance at<b> UiTM Kota Bharu.</b> I got a different experience here because this is a campus that is characterized by an city campus. I enjoy studying here.</p>
